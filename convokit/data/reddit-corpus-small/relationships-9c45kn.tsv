9c45kn	1535817650	"It all began after the first month we started dating and I don’t know why I didn’t end things right then and there. While I was taming a shower, he looked through all of the photos on my laptop and yelled at me cause I still had photos of me and my ex. I didn’t even remember, cause I don’t look at those photos and I guess I was too lazy to delete them. Also, I don’t use that laptop so often since it’s slow, soooo yeah, I wasn’t being sentimental.

I’ve always been a nosy person and I admit I stalked his wall, his exes, even his parents, BUT it was all public info. I’ve been alone with his laptop/phone etc. but I’ve never ever even thought about reading his private conversations. I wouldn’t do that to anyone. He doesn’t care, though. He memorized my ipad password and he read everything, including some really private posts here on reddit. He yelled at me and broke up with me. 

He occasionally lurks in my facebook account, because I’m dumb and I’m always like “No, he wouldn’t do that again” but he always does. Today I was logged on our shared laptop and I saw in my fb app that there was some activity going on 40 minutes ago while I was taking a shower. I looked the chrome history, but he had deleted everything. I lost it and I started crying and he had the audacity to blame me for his trust issues and said that there is something I’m hiding since I’m reacting this way. I tried to explain I have nothing to hide, but it’s just horrible to feel uncomfortable at home. I can’t even sleep properly anymore because I’m nervous if he’ll decide to randomly read my messages. He scrolled maybe months of my fb searches which is really embarrassing and yelled at me again. He said I must be hiding something since I’m so upset. I don’t hide anything and I never gave him a reason not too trust me. Once he dumped me and I grabbed a beer with an old friend and he found out, blamed me for cheating on him and even complained to my mother. I go to therapy every week (not only because of him, I have other issues). There was this group session and I met a boy who has similar problems to mine and I felt that finally I’d have someone outside therapy to talk to. He’s not my type and I didn’t like him in a romantic way, I just felt we could be friends but my boyfriend found out we’ve talked once (because he was snooping again ofc) and again yelled at me. He said I was a cheater and that’s why he had trust issues. I’ve always been faithful and I didn’t deserve this. 

I changed all my passwords but I’m tired of feeling uncomfortable in my own home. He went out and told me I deserve this and he’s right to invade my privacy and I have no right to be mad. I don’t know what to do anymore.

Tl;dr: Boyfriend is invading my privacy and blames me for his trust issues 

Update: Thank you so much for the comments and support! I finally picked up some courage and ended this pathetic excuse of a relationship and you all helped me a lot! Two days ago he came with his mother (omg) to collect his stuff and also took the laptop he gave me as present, which was pathetic. I’m feeling so much better now.

e58ecar	1535836828	"“The more psychotherapy an abusive man has participated in, the more impossible I usually find it is to work with him.

The highly “therapized” abuser tends to be slick, condescending, and manipulative. He uses the psychological concepts he has learned to dissect his partner’s flaws and dismiss her perceptions of abuse. He takes responsibility for nothing that he does; he moves in a world where there are only unfortunate dynamics, miscommunications, symbolic acts. He expects to be rewarded for his emotional openness, handled gingerly because of his “vulnerability,” colluded with in skirting the damage he has done, and congratulated for his insight.

Many years ago, a violent abuser in my program shared the following with us: “From working in therapy on my issues about anger toward my mother, I realized that when I punched my wife, it wasn’t really her I was hitting. It was my mother!” He sat back, ready for us to express our approval of his self-awareness. My colleague peered through his glasses at the man, unimpressed by this revelation. “No,” he said, “you were hitting your wife.”

I have yet to meet an abuser who has made any meaningful and lasting changes in his behavior toward female partners through therapy, regardless of how much “insight”—most of it false—that he may have gained. The fact is that if an abuser finds a particularly skilled therapist and if the therapy is especially successful, when he is finished he will be a happy, well-adjusted abuser—good news for him, perhaps, but not such good news for his partner. Psychotherapy can be very valuable for the issues it is devised to address, but partner abuse is not one of them; an abusive man needs to be in a specialized program.”

I swear I had heard this advice on Loveline back in the day, so I'd say it's a pretty old piece of advice.

If you look up ""Why We Don’t Recommend Couples Counseling for Abusive Relationships"", you'll see an article from thehotline about why it's a bad idea.

&gt;In order for couples counseling to be successful, both partners must be willing to take responsibility for their actions and make adjustments to their behavior. **Abusive people want all of the power and control in the relationship and will focus on maintaining that imbalance, even if it means continuing unhealthy and hurtful behavior patterns. Many callers to the Hotline have related stories of trying and “failing” at couples counseling because of an abusive partner’s focus on manipulating the sessions to place blame, minimize the abuse, and attempt to win over the therapist to their side.** If the therapist tries to hold the abusive partner accountable for these tactics, they will often refuse to attend further sessions and may even forbid their partner to see the “biased” therapist again. The abusive partner may even choose to escalate the abuse because they feel their power and control was threatened."

Eventually, my ex stormed out, leaving me sobbing alone. The therapist gently informed me that I was welcome to come back, but the dynamic with my ex was toxic and my ex could not come back. 

When I got home, my ex flipped on me. He spent the next several weeks blaming and guilt-tripping me for “demonizing” him in therapy, and doing the wounded-animal act abusers sometimes do when it was very “oh woe, you’ve wounded me to the core.” I regretted every second that we’d gone to therapy and wished we’d never done it.

In the end, it just became one more thing he gaslit me over and used against me. 

No healthy therapy is possible with an abuser, because they’re not actually interested in changing. They just want to retain their control. And if the therapist sees through it (as many do) and doesn’t allow them to impose their worldview on the therapy, they will go off the rails.

He didn't respect my emotional privacy and would dig through conversations with my best frielnd once he didn't find anything to be mad about in messages with guys. And it happened twice!! (After promising me never again after the first time) huge deal breaker for me. When I caught him the second time I ended it on the spot. He was on his knees sobbing and apologizing, it was absolutely horrific. But he knew it was my deal-breaker and did it anyway. That's on him, not on me. And it's not on you OP if he is invading your emotional privacy to the point you feel completely exposed and helpless. 

(I'm simplifying of course. It's not easy to essentially dump yourself over someone else's actions forcing you to. And I'm lucky we had been together less than a year and he revealed this side of himself early enough that I was very wary and resentful to begin with so it was easier to leave. But aside from that we'd grown very close and I do miss him. But ultimately I can't live knowing each new friend comes at the sacrifice of hurting my relationship, or never being allowed to be friendly with new people if I want to preserve peace.

You'll feel like he's the only person in your life, which makes it harder for you to leave. He'll create rifts between you and your family for the same reason. Then he'll want you to stop working - he makes enough and he can take care of you! Now he makes all the money and you have no control over any of it, meaning you can't leave even if you wanted to. How would you get an apartment with no job and no money?? Then things really escalate, he becomes physically and sexually violent, but you're too embarrassed to ask for help from the family and friends you alienated long ago.

That's just another thing they do. ""I am so hurt that you say the things I do to you caused you pain. My hurt over this is worse than the harm I did to you in the first place. Maybe YOU are abusing ME with this?""

It's tricky, because I could also turn that around to be true-ish. Like ""You're hiding things from me on purpose, then I get worried and then you have the nerve to tell me this is my fault, you're gaslighting me.""

Now, I'm NOT saying this is the case, but once there is abuse in a relationship, the abusing partner can twist it whichever way they want. That's why the rule of thumb should be: Once there is abuse, the relationship must end.

Okay, now I’m convinced that you’re being groomed for escalating abuse from this guy. He’s isolated you through his disapproval of your friends so no one tries to tell you how awful what he does to you really is, and you never leave. 

You feel like he sees you like a brainless creature *because that is exactly how he treats you.* 

This will *only* get worse and *you deserve better.* Please, please leave him."	afternoonbeauty	e599ay6	9c45kn	5	e57uesk	1538583971	0	{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}	relationships	False	/r/relationships/comments/9c45kn/boyfriend_26m_cant_stop_invading_my_privacy_to/e59ex1z/		[]

e59kxwj	1535896966	"Therapy fixes communication problems, not character deficiency. Your boyfriend believes he owns you. Therapy doesn't fix flawed values, unless he admits he has a problem and is willing to work on himself, but the core essence of entitlement is refusing to acknowledge you have a problem to begin with. And even then, he'd have to do the work outside of your relationship.

In sum, YOU cannot fix him with therapy. You need to get out of there."	[deleted]	e57v9n4	9c45kn	1	e57uesk	1538586798	0	{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}	relationships	False	/r/relationships/comments/9c45kn/boyfriend_26m_cant_stop_invading_my_privacy_to/e59kxwj/		[]
e59mty4	1535899044	"Op, I recommend you to break up as soon as possible. 
I had same problem with girlfriend, when we started to date, my ex sometimes texted me some friendly stuff, cause we already kinda exhausted each other and she was in other relationship too, but after several years together we developed some soulmate atmosphere and it was kinda hard to avoid it. 
Of course, it wasn’t taken warmly by my new gf, and to be fair I found it’s pretty justifiable, so at some point, I cut off completely from my ex, blocking and canceling everywhere, it wasn’t move I liked, but I wanted it to be better for my new love interest. Things didn’t changed for my gf tho, she was always suspicious and testing me, like she liked to ask me out of blue, how is my ex..
She never stopped at stalking and snooping, often taking my phone and checking my browser history when it was super embarrassing, like I googled sometimes some weird stuff before bed like “how hippos breath underwater” or “why mosquito bites can be itchy” lol.

So she checked everything and cause in my native language can be spelled in different ways she tried all variations in message history trying to find at least something, once she found out that one of my buddies liked one specific trait of my ex more than my current one, I defended my gf here saying, that she excels in many more other qualities, and it doesn’t matter. Still my girlfriend made big scene out of it, that even Ex name was brought up and of course hating my friend. 

We broke up with her later, in few years, we just were tired of each other, and I started to distance myself out, at some point after series of spectacle “I’m leaving you” I realized that it’s my time to take the reins and finally be over with it. In the end of the day, I realized that this stalking, invasion of privacy and constant suspicion made those relationships a failure, it was rotting slowly from inside.

I learned the hard way. Invited ex to attend equine assisted therapy with our kids. 
4 sessions in of him doing nothing but bad mouthing me, everything about me. 
I had enough and ended that right then and there. 
Horses even had enough of his bullshit and one of the horses smacked him in the face with his tail. I shit you not.
